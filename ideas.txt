instead of using classes for card/deck..
binary ?

value ranges from 1-10
thus 001 -> 1010

first 4 bits are reserved for value of card
(since ace is the only card that can equal 1, 
we can differentiate and use 10 instead when necessary)

4 different card types, we can use 3 bits to represent
000 -> nothing
001 (16) -> spades
010 (32) -> diamonds
100 (64) -> clubs
011 (48) -> hearts

or only use 2 bits ? (nah dont)
00 -> spades
01 -> diamonds
11 -> clubs
10 -> hearts
